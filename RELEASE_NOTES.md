## v0.2.0 - Global Remote Access (Web Mode) 🌍

**Release Date:** January 21, 2026

---

### ✨ NEW: World-Wide Remote Access

## v0.1.7 - Robustness & Stability Update 🛡️

**Release Date:** January 21, 2026

---

### ✨ Key Improvements

#### 🔄 Smart Reconnection

- **Auto-Recovery**: Server now automatically detects lost CDP connections (e.g., if you close/reopen Antigravity) and reconnects without needing a restart.
- **Resilient Startup**: You can now start the server *before* Antigravity. It will patiently poll ("🔍 Looking for Antigravity...") until it finds the debug port.
- **Context Awareness**: Improved logic to track active execution contexts, preventing "stuck" snapshots when tabs are closed or refreshed.

#### 🛠️ Frontend & Performance

- **Client-Side Rendering**: Fixed a critical bug where the mobile client would hang on loading due to a syntax error in dynamic CSS injection.
- **Optimized Capture**: Rewrote the CSS gathering logic to use array joining instead of string concatenation, improving performance on large chat histories.
- **Syntax Fixes**: Corrected template literal escaping in the snapshot capture script (`\n` vs `\\n`) to prevent runtime evaluation errors.

#### 🔍 Enhanced Diagnostics

- **Throttled Logging**: Added intelligent logging that warns about common issues (like "cascade not found") only once every 10 seconds, preventing console spam.
- **Actionable Tips**: Error messages now include helpful hints (e.g., "Tip: Ensure an active chat is open in Antigravity").

#### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Registry Path Handling**: Fixed `install_context_menu.bat` to correctly handle installation paths containing spaces (wrapping `%V` in quotes).
- **Process Cleanup**: Improved the "Auto-Port Kill" feature to be more reliable on Windows.

## v0.1.6 - Mobile Copy & Stability Improvements 📋

**Release Date:** January 20, 2026

---

### ✨ New Features

#### 📋 Mobile Code Block Copy Button

- **One-Tap Copy**: Small copy icon appears next to all code blocks on mobile
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on Android, iOS, Windows, and macOS browsers
- **Visual Feedback**: Icon turns into a green checkmark (✓) on successful copy
- **Clipboard API**: Uses modern `navigator.clipboard` with fallback to `execCommand` for older browsers
- **Minimal Design**: Icon-only button, no text, no frame - clean and unobtrusive

#### 🔄 Automatic Port Cleanup

- **No More EADDRINUSE**: Server automatically kills any existing process on port 3000 before starting
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows (`taskkill`), Linux (`kill`), and macOS (`kill`)
- **Console Notification**: Shows `⚠️ Killed existing process on port 3000 (PID: XXXX)` when cleanup occurs

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

#### 📜 Scroll Jumping Fix

- **Problem**: When scrolling on phone, the view would jump to bottom after each snapshot update
- **Solution**: Added 3-second scroll lock that respects user scroll position
- **Smart Detection**: Auto-scroll resumes when user scrolls back to bottom or taps scroll-to-bottom button
- **Percentage-Based**: Uses scroll percentage for more accurate position restoration

### 📄 Documentation Updates

- **README.md**: Completely reorganized Quick Start into 4 clear steps with correct order
- **CODE_DOCUMENTATION.md**: Updated Execution Flow section with startup sequence requirements
- **Added Warning**: Clear callout that order matters - Antigravity + chat must be running before server

### 🚀 Startup Sequence (Important!)

> ⚠️ The order of steps matters! Follow this sequence:

1. **Start Antigravity** with `--remote-debugging-port=9000`
2. **Open or start a chat** in Antigravity
3. **Run the server** (`start_ag_phone_connect.bat` or `.sh`)
4. **Connect your phone** using the displayed URL

## v0.1.5 - HTTPS & Scroll Sync 🔒

**Release Date:** January 17, 2026

---

### 🎉 Highlights

This release introduces **HTTPS support**, **scroll synchronization**, and several bug fixes to improve the overall experience.

### ✨ New Features

#### 🔒 HTTPS Support

- **Secure connections** with self-signed SSL certificates
- **Hybrid certificate generation**: Tries OpenSSL first (for proper IP SAN support), falls back to Node.js crypto (zero dependencies)
- **Auto-detection**: Server automatically uses HTTPS when certificates are present
- **Web UI button**: "Enable HTTPS" banner for one-click certificate generation
- **Git for Windows support**: Automatically finds OpenSSL bundled with Git

#### 📜 Scroll Sync

- **Bi-directional scrolling**: When you scroll on your phone, the desktop Antigravity scrolls too
- **Virtualized content support**: Triggers snapshot reload after scrolling to capture newly rendered messages
- **Debounced**: 150ms debounce to prevent excessive requests

#### 📄 New Documentation

- **SECURITY.md**: Comprehensive security guide with:
  - Browser warning bypass instructions (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge)
  - Certificate verification commands
  - Security model explanation
  - OpenSSL installation guide

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

#### Message Sending

- **Fixed**: "Error sending: Unknown" popup no longer appears when message is successfully sent
- **Fixed**: Message input now clears immediately after sending (optimistic UI)
- **Changed**: `/send` endpoint now always returns 200 OK

#### CSS Formatting

- **Fixed**: Double-escaped newline in CSS capture that was breaking phone formatting

#### IP Detection

- **Fixed**: Now prioritizes real network IPs (192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x) over virtual adapters (172.x.x.x from WSL/Docker)
- **Fixed**: Server now displays only one URL instead of multiple confusing options

### 🔌 New API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/ssl-status` | GET | Returns HTTPS status and certificate info |
| `/generate-ssl` | POST | Generates SSL certificates via web UI |
| `/remote-scroll` | POST | Syncs phone scroll position to desktop |

### 🔧 Technical Details

#### HTTPS Implementation

- Uses Node.js built-in `https` module
- Certificates stored in `./certs/` (gitignored)
- Server checks for `certs/server.key` and `certs/server.cert` on startup
- WebSocket automatically upgrades to `wss://` when HTTPS is enabled

#### Scroll Sync Implementation

- Uses percentage-based scrolling for cross-device consistency
- Handles Antigravity's virtualized scrolling by:
  1. Scrolling desktop to position
  2. Waiting 300ms for content to render
  3. Capturing fresh snapshot
  4. Sending to phone
